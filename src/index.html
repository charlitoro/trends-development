    <p>The Internet's growth has become explosive and it seems impossible to escape the bombardment 
      of www.com's seen constantly on television, heard on radio, and seen in magazines. Because the 
      Internet has become such a large part of our lives, a good understanding is needed to use this 
      new tool most effectively.
    </p>
    <p>Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet 
        must have a unique address. Internet addresses are in the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must 
        be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address. (IP stands for Internet 
        Protocol; more on this later.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you connect to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you are usually assigned 
      a temporary IP address for the duration of your dial-in session. If you connect to the Internet 
      from a local area network (LAN) your computer might have a permanent IP address or it might obtain 
      a temporary one from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. In any case, if you are 
      connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique IP address.

      <h3 id="protocol-stack">Protocol Stack</h3>
      <p>
        Every computer needs one to communicate on the Internet and it is usually built into the computer's 
        operating system (i.e. Windows, Unix, etc.). The protocol stack used on the Internet is refered to 
        as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major communication protocols used. The TCP/IP stack 
        looks like this: 
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <th scope="col"> Protocol Layer</th>
          <th scope="col"> Comments </th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> Application Protocols Layer </th>
            <td> Protocols specific to applications such as WWW, e-mail, FTP, etc. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> Transmission Control Protocol Layer (TCP/IP) </th>
            <td> TCP directs packets to a specific application on a computer using a port number. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> User Datagram Protocol (UDP) </th>
            <td> UDP uses the Internet Protocol to get a datagram (data unit) from one computer to another </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        TCP and UDP are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which includes a number of 
        protocols for carrying out network communications.

      <h3 id="dns"> Domain Names and Address Resolution (DNS)</h3>

      <p>
        The DNS is a distributed database which keeps track of computer's names and their 
        corresponding IP addresses on the Internet. Many computers connected to the Internet host part of 
        the DNS database and the software that allows others to access it. These computers are known as DNS 
        servers. No DNS server contains the entire database; they only contain a subset of it. If a DNS 
        server does not contain the domain name requested by another computer, the DNS server re-directs 
        the requesting computer to another DNS server.

      <p>
        Client-server architecture is an architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) 
        request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface 
        to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. 
        Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a 
        standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the 
        system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.
