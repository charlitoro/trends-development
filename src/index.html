    <p>The Internet's growth has become explosive and it seems impossible to escape the bombardment 
      of www.com's seen constantly on television, heard on radio, and seen in magazines. Because the 
      Internet has become such a large part of our lives, a good understanding is needed to use this 
      new tool most effectively.
    </p>
    <p>Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet 
        must have a unique address. Internet addresses are in the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must 
        be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address. (IP stands for Internet 
        Protocol; more on this later.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you connect to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you are usually assigned 
      a temporary IP address for the duration of your dial-in session. If you connect to the Internet 
      from a local area network (LAN) your computer might have a permanent IP address or it might obtain 
      a temporary one from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. In any case, if you are 
      connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique IP address. 
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3 id="dns"> Domain Names and Address Resolution (DNS)</h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: cursive; font-size: x-large;">
        172.78.5.21 --> www.domine.com
      </p>
      <p>
        The DNS is a distributed database which keeps track of computer's names and their 
        corresponding IP addresses on the Internet. Many computers connected to the Internet host part of 
        the DNS database and the software that allows others to access it. These computers are known as DNS 
        servers. No DNS server contains the entire database; they only contain a subset of it. If a DNS 
        server does not contain the domain name requested by another computer, the DNS server re-directs 
        the requesting computer to another DNS server.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="protocol-stack">Protocol Stack</h3>
      <p>
        Every computer needs one to communicate on the Internet and it is usually built into the computer's 
        operating system (i.e. Windows, Unix, etc.). The protocol stack used on the Internet is refered to 
        as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major communication protocols used. The TCP/IP stack 
        looks like this: 
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <th scope="col"> Protocol Layer</th>
          <th scope="col"> Comments </th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> Application Protocols Layer </th>
            <td> Protocols specific to applications such as WWW, e-mail, FTP, etc. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> Transmission Control Protocol Layer (TCP/IP) </th>
            <td> TCP directs packets to a specific application on a computer using a port number. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"> User Datagram Protocol (UDP) </th>
            <td> UDP uses the Internet Protocol to get a datagram (data unit) from one computer to another </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        TCP and UDP are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which includes a number of 
        protocols for carrying out network communications.

      <h3 id="http-request">HTTP Request</h3>
      <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is used to structure requests and responses over 
        the internet. HTTP requires data to be transferred from one point to another over the network. </p>
      <h4 id="request-method">Request method</h4>
      <p> A request message from a client to a server includes, within the first line of that message, 
        the method to be applied to the resource, the identifier of the resource, and the protocol version 
        in use. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>GET: </strong> GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
          GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is 
          sent in the URL of a GET request:</p>
          <mark>/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2 </mark>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <p><strong>POST: </strong>POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
            The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:</p>
          <mark>
            POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1 <br>
            Host: w3schools.com <br>
            name1=value1&name2=value2
          </mark> <br>
          <p>POST is one of the most common HTTP methods. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>PUT: </strong> PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
            The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the 
            same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a 
            POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Client-server architecture is an architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) 
        request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface 
        to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. 
        Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a 
        standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the 
        system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.

        From AI to Cloud, there are as many software development trends predictions as there are people. 
        The diversity and complexity of the IT world make compiling an exhaustive forecast nearly impossible
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>#1 Python:</b> Let us start with Python: a high-level dynamically typed programming 
            language that has been gaining momentum in the IT world for quite a while. Conceived and 
            first implemented around 30 years ago, it is the most loved and the third best-known 
            programming language in the contemporary developer community according to the CodinGame 
            2020 Developer Survey. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>#2 Golang: </b> The second suggestion for backend development in 2020 is a statically typed, 
            compiling programming language: Go, also known as Golang. Released in 2009, it has been named 
            the Programming Language of the Year by TIOBE twice so far and – while it’s surely less popular 
            than the above-mentioned Python – it’s been mentioned as the most loved technology by 68% of 
            Stack Overflow survey’s respondents last year.

            <b>#3 Node.js: </b> Let’s start from the very beginning, namely the fact that Node.js is a 
            JavaScript-based solution. Therefore, using it for backend development in 2020 allows you to 
            enjoy all the benefits of this high-level programming language, the most important of which 
            is its immense popularity.

      <h4 id="frontend">Fontend Development</h4>
      <p>When you are not on top of every new technology or tool being released, you can quickly lose pace. 
        The web development industry is constantly changing, and as a developer you should always be ready 
        to continue learning, or you’ll risk falling behind your competitors.

          <p><b>React: </b><br>

            React is the front-end framework created and developed by Facebook. The team was interested in 
            obtaining high performance by building an effective UI. Jordan Walke proposed to create the 
            library based on XHP and JavaScript combination in 2011. As a result, they received the library 
            to build the web interface with JavaScript where the news update happens at the same time while 
            customers use the chat. Facebook released the open-source JavaScript tool in 2013. They 
            continued the framework development and released React Native for Android and iOS in 2015.

            Vue.js is the web framework for building user interfaces. It is an independent tool that creates 
            web interfaces and doesn’t require the additional extension. Vue.js was created by Evan You and 
            initially released in February 2014. Probably you might not find the long list of big companies 
            using Vue.js but it is definitely popular among developers and the framework popularity considerably increases.

            <br>
            Angular or Angular v2 or Angular 2+ is a complete rewrite of AngularJS by the same team in Google 
            who developed the original front-end framework in 2010. It was released in September of 2016 as a 
            completely new framework with new logic and features to address the challenges of web development 
            as we know it today. Even the naming called a hot discussion in the development community, and it 
            is needless to say that the complete absence of backward compatibility with AngularJS caused a huge 
            controversy. Those who trusted Google and Angular community weren’t able to just upgrade their 
            application to the new Google front-end framework version to get all the new trendy dev tools and 
            features. The app should be rewritten from scratch with Angular.

      <p>
        It’s a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot, but it’s not because artificial intelligence (AI) 
        is being overhyped — it’s because modern technology is finally powerful enough to make AI tools a 
        reality. Whether it’s through deep learning, machine learning or broader artificially intelligent 
        applications, organizations are depending on AI to fundamentally transform their industries.

      <p>
        Bitcoin may have kicked its own cryptocurrency revolution, but its underlying software — blockchain — 
        is poised to have an even greater effect on the future of development. The beauty of blockchain is 
        its decentralized nature: It can store any type of record in a public-facing database that’s nearly 
        impossible for a hacker to alter or corrupt.

      <h4 id="iot">IoT</h4>
      <p>
        The internet of things (IoT) has finally begun to emerge all around us. From Bluetooth trackers to 
        smart microwaves, internet-connected devices are no longer relegated to computers and cell phones. 
        As technologies like 5G begin to roll out, more devices can take advantage of better wireless 
        bandwidth and power efficiency, bringing to life new and exciting possibilities for the future of IoT.
